        <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals, which involves consciousness and emotionality. The distinction between the former and the latter categories is often revealed by the acronym chosen. 'Strong' AI is usually labelled as artificial general intelligence (AGI) while attempts to emulate 'natural' intelligence have been called artificial biological intelligence (ABI). Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of achieving its goals.[3] Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is often used to describe machines that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem solving".[4]

            As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect.[5] A quip in Tesler's Theorem says "AI is whatever hasn't been done yet."[6] For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI,[7] having become a routine technology.[8] Modern machine capabilities generally classified as AI include successfully understanding human speech,[9] competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go),[10] and also imperfect-information games like poker,[11] self-driving cars, intelligent routing in content delivery networks, and military simulations.[12]
            
            Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1955, and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism,[13][14] followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an "AI winter"),[15][16] followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding.[14][17] After AlphaGo defeated a professiona

        <p>once again attracted widespread global attention.[18] For most of its history, AI research has been divided into sub-fields that often fail to communicate with each other.[19] These sub-fields are based on technical considerations, such as particular goals (e.g. "robotics" or "machine learning"),[20] the use of particular tools ("logic" or artificial neural networks), or deep philosophical differences.[23][24][25] Sub-fields have also been based on social factors (particular institutions or the work of particular researchers).[19]

            The traditional problems (or goals) of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects.[20] AGI is among the field's long-term goals.[26] Approaches include statistical methods, computational intelligence, and traditional symbolic AI. Many tools are used in AI, including versions of search and mathematical optimization, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, probability and economics. The AI field draws upon computer science, information engineering, mathematics, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and many other fields.
            
            The field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence "can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it".[27] This raises philosophical arguments about the mind and the ethics of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence. These issues have been explored by myth, fiction and philosophy since antiquity.[32] Some people also consider AI to be a danger to humanity if it progresses unabated.[33][34] Others believe that AI, unlike previous technological revolutions, will create a risk of mass unemployment.[35]
            
            In the twenty-first century, AI techniques have experienced a resurgence following concurrent advances in computer power, large amounts of data, and theoretical understanding; and AI techniques have become an essential part of the technology industry, helping to solve many challenging problems in computer science, software engineering and operations research.[36][17

        <p>The extensive set of applications for IoT devices is often divided into consumer, commercial, industrial, and
            infrastructure spaces.

            </li>
            <p>A smart home or automated home could be based on a platform or hubs that control smart devices and
                appliances. For instance, using Apple's HomeKit, manufacturers can have their home products and
                accessories
                controlled by an application in iOS devices such as the iPhone and the Apple Watch.This could be a
                dedicated app or iOS native applications such as Siri.This can be demonstrated in the case of Lenovo's
                Smart Home Essentials, which is a line of smart home devices that are controlled through Apple's Home
                app or
                Siri without the need for a Wi-Fi bridge.There are also dedicated smart home hubs that are offered as
                standalone platforms to connect different smart home products and these include the Amazon Echo, Google
                Home,
                Apple's HomePod, and Samsung's SmartThings Hub.In addition to the commercial systems, there are many
                non-proprietary, open source ecosystems; including Home Assistant, OpenHAB and Domoticz.

            <p>The IoT can connect various manufacturing devices equipped with sensing, identification, processing,
                communication, actuation, and networking capabilities.Network control and management of
                manufacturing equipment, asset and situation management, or manufacturing process control allow IoT to
                be used for industrial applications and smart manufacturing.IoT intelligent systems enable rapid
                manufacturing and optimization of new products, and rapid response to product demands.
